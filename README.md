# You don't want to be human anymore ? Play ! 

"I don't want to be human anymore" is a virtual reality puzzle game created with Unity. 

## <i>Synopsis</i>
You are God. Even better, you are Odin, the God of all
Gods, the Omniscient and Almighty Father of human civil-
isation. Until you are not anymore. One day, you wake
up without any powers in Helheim, the deepest island of
the Nine Worlds. You need to solve this mystery and even
more importantly, you need to regain access to Asgard,
the Valley of Gods located at the top of the great Tree Yg-
gdrasil. For this, you will be going from island to island,
always climbing a level in Yggdrasil in direction of your
home. The path will not be easy as your enemy has put
several obstacles to stop you. But you are not human, and
the more you climb, the more you regain your divine en-
ergy. This energy will help you access a limited god-like
mode that can move and manipulate objects in a way that
a simple mortal could not even dream of. Welcome to ”I
don’t want to be human anymore”, the game where you
will regain your entitled powers and that permits you to
become who you really are
